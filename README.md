# 3x3
This is my first side project written in C/C++. I've tried to incropreate all much as i've learned from my ece 150 (Fundamentals of Programming from the University  of Waterloo. For my first time, this was quite an experience and a jounry. It was amazing how fun over coming the challenges that faced me was. I hope to continue developing and become a better person alone the way. 

A few 'new' things that i've learnt to use during this program was <chrono> and <random>. In class we were more or less forced to "hack" our way through the assigments but now i've learnt to respect the powers of the library. Using chrono I could achieve microsecond accuracy. While with random I could create a uniformly distributed sequence to generate my scramble. 

I've asked for a code review of this project on stackexhange and got some amazing feedback. I will be learning from my mistakes for my next project and fix some one the ones here. Love the community!  


Please download and use it for your personal pleasures and hope you beat that PR, i know i'm working hard to beat mine.
